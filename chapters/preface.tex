\chapter*{Preface}

This is a lab notebook intended to give you experience with
uncertainty analysis, experimental methods, and numerical methods in
physics.  All text with a bold P designation (\textbf{P1.1} for
example) indicates a task to be done.  Usually this will involve
writing something in your lab notebook.  Please be as complete and
neat as possible.

Any tasks that requires a computer will be done using the Python
programming language.  You can obtain a free copy of Python \href{https://store.enthought.com/downloads/}{here}.  
Any computer code that you create should be uploaded to the Google
Drive folder provided.

There is a companion book to this one entitled, ``Introduction to
Python''.  It is intended to help you learn to use Python to do the
tasks contained herein.
